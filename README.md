# My Site

A personal portfolio site using Github Pages. I'm using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the components from my project, [BootstrapX](http://maxshalom.me/BootstrapX/).

Currently `index.html` is a placeholder for the website and I am developing on `site.html`. Soon, I will replace `index.html` with `site.html`.
