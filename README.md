# Max Shalom - My Site

A personal portfolio site using Github Pages. I'm using some components from the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to develop, and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) for design.

If you'd like, [fork](https://github.com/MaxShalom/maxshalom.github.io/fork) the repository and make it your own.

View it at [maxshalom.me](maxshalom.me) and if you have any suggestions, let me know.
