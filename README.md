# My Site

A personal portfolio site using Github Pages. I'm using some components from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework, from my project, [BootstrapX](http://maxshalom.me/BootstrapX/), and many components from the [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) framework.

Currently `index.html` is where the website is and I am playing around on `site.html`. `index.html` is linked with `style.css` and `site.html` is linked with `holder.css`.

View it at [maxshalom.me](maxshalom.me) and help out if you can.
